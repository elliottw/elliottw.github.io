# Breakdowns
**Trust in the Data**
- What data comes from ScriptSourcing versus Highmark?
- Total amount paid is less than total amount allowed, I think I’m getting a good deal but I don’t really know
- Double check data
- Double check data for strange data
- Why is Lens pulling from 2017
- Is this file feed from my broker?
- Never another follow up data check after the first one

**Coding Issues**
- Member IDs aren’t useful, can’t validate those claims are correct
- User googled preventative codes and found 4 but there are really 12, so user saw incorrect data

**Data Timing**
- By the time claims are visible it's too late for interventions
- Most Critical Data: High Claimants shown only after the fact

**Competing w/ Excel**
- I would be scrolling blindly looking for when there’s a big cost or chemo
- Failed to run pivot in lens
- Found it quicker and easier to edit in Excel
- Quicker and easier to do task in excel
- Uses pivot tables in Excel due to the limits inside of Lens
- Tried to create a metric that produces a 1 for every individual and then could do math

**Insight Workflow**
- If a client just wanted this one page, it’s easier to delete everything else than to start a new one
- Would like to clone inside an insight
- Would like to save as, but can’t
- I’d have to clone and look for radiation, clone again for chemo
- User would like to be able to clone an insight while editing the insight
- Currently user can only save over the current from this view.

**Navigation**
- Total spend graph: two colors, med/pharma, click in and see breakdown --competitor view
- Looking for feed files went to my files first

**Managing Cohorts**
- Get instant benefit with zero effort (captive member) so why try?
- We have to work together to keep saving (captive members)
- You don’t do anything with the data (clients)
- your not taking action or can’t use the data (captive members)
 
**Load Times**
- Loading Error
- Long load times means I leave Lens and do something else
- 3+ minutes of  waiting
- Nothing loading
- One load took 1 minute 10 seconds
- Loading was just so slow, user didn’t know if it was working or not
 
**General Usability**
- Constantly need todo these things to remember how to do them
- Did multitask but the insights, dashboards, and filters bogged him down
- Can’t find Pharmacy in fields, first tried dimensions then tried measures which are actually filters
- You don’t know what data to look at or how to measure client cost savings
- User tried to answer this within lens and failed, doesn’t know how to start
- It’s just not realistic to train employees on lens

**Data Requests**
- does onsite screenings, file feed from healthceck 360 w blood, a1c3, bp, cholesterol, user wants to qury this data
- quantify savings, but also level of effort
- medical model doesn’t show people without claims
 
**Quick Questions**
- Who has health issues and no claims?
- Who’s 16, are they covered? I can’t tell in lens
- try to answer easy questions in lens like 40-45 mamo
- I can’t filter dashboards by things i’ve created

**Presentation**
- I have to format the data
- Would be nice to present straight from lens
- If reporting could be done in front of the client or prospect it would be used, but using the tool in front of a client makes the user look like they are incompetent. so basically it’s a liability to use lens in front of clients “it would convey incompetence” 
- Show us how you got the secret sauce? (user can’t show because it would show incompetence)
