# Service Blueprinting for Alignment
Capital One's wealth management team was struggling to launch. There wasn't an overarching understanding of all the moving parts between calendaring with Wealth Managers, backend infrastructure, and design requirements.

I worked with my design team to create a single diagram outlining all the steps of the service experience, while tying in the underlying components needed to actually build the thing.

The diagram illustrated a clear line between what the user would experience and all the underlying parts needed to make that experience a reality:

While also coordinating work to be done across design, development, wealth manangement, and content:

In the end, we had a living document that not only had the current state of tasks to be done, but also gave all the teams a central source of truth and reference point:
