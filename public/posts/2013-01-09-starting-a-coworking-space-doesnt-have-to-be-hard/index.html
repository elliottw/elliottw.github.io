<p>I got a grant from a local non-profit that allowed me to open a co-working space for one month. This grant included enough for rent, and that was about it. After one month, I had 12 people signed up and ready to go. After that landlord raised the rent by 50 percent, and after waiting to find a new space, I had 6 members left (it took 4 months to find a new home). This step isn&rsquo;t that necessary, if you have people, get a space, if you don&rsquo;t have people, don&rsquo;t get a space. I started with only 6 people. If you built it, more will come.</p>

<p>We were the first tenants in a space, 5139 Penn Ave., in the Garfield neighborhood of Pittsburgh. We&rsquo;re on the same block as an art community space, a co-operative music venue, and an awesome pizza shop. The space isn&rsquo;t the prettiest, but we&rsquo;ve got 2000 square feet for about 1000 a month in rent, and the building is so well made that we&rsquo;re paying less for heat than my one bedroom apartment.</p>
<ul>
<li>1800 dollars for first and last months rent</li>
<li>500 for 10 Ikea Vika Amon Tables and legs</li>
<li>500 for 10 Ikea Jules Swivle Chairs</li>
<li>100 for several tables and chairs I scraped from craigslist</li>
<li>0 for donated coffee grinder and chemex, utensils, dorm sized fridge</li>
<li>24 for 3 makeshift whiteboards (go to home depot and by 8&rsquo;x4&rsquo; shower stall walls)</li>
<li>15 for whiteboard markers</li>
<li>60 for cloth hand towels (we have the cleaning girl wash and fold each week)</li>
<li>600 for gas and electric deposits. This was an unexpected cost, apparently even if residents don&rsquo;t have to leave deposits, businesses do. These were paid gradually over the first year.</li>
</ul>

<p>Within the first year we paid ourselves back the complete initial investment.</p>

<p>Right now we use Freshbooks to send out monthly reoccurring invoices. All expenses are handled with Freshbooks as well. Since we don&rsquo;t set hard limits on days in the office, we don&rsquo;t need any way to track or reserve. If we start getting too many part-timers, we&rsquo;ll just buy more tables.</p>

<p>I personally would consider the first year of <a href="http://catapultpgh.org">Catapult</a> a success. My goal was to break even and pay myself back, and I did that. In addition, there are a million intangible benefits such as waking up each morning and getting to work in an awesome community of motivated people, being able to trade/barter services, learning Clojure, getting instant design critiques and instant design/code help, and offering just as much as I&rsquo;m getting.</p>
<p>Moving forward, I don&rsquo;t really know where this is going to go. Honestly, I feel like I&rsquo;m not in control of it either. I always dream of getting a new building and shooting out an email to Catapult saying something like &ldquo;hey guys, got this sweet new building for us, we&rsquo;re moving two blocks down in the next 3 months&rdquo; and then getting a unanimous response &ldquo;that&rsquo;s cool, we&rsquo;ll stay here&rdquo;. That would never happen, but the nagging image just reminds me that I&rsquo;m not completely in control of where this group goes. We&rsquo;re a community, and although I can foster and cultivate, I cannot really direct. I&rsquo;m just <em>one</em> lever on the machine. I am thinking of moving in with an artist friend and her cooperative of artists, thinking of rolling my own design work into the Catapult umbrella and turning this thing into a super ad-hock full stack design shop, but those are just dreams. We&rsquo;ll see what the next year brings.</p>
