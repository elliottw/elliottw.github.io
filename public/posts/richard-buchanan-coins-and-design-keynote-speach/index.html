Richard Buchanan was a professor at Carnegie Mellon&#39;s Design School before leaving for the Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western. He&#39;s a personal hero of mine, and one of the few people moving design into spaces that were previously owned by business and management. He recently gave a keynote talk at COINs and you should definitely check it out on livestream <a href="http://www.livestream.com/newchannel/popoutplayer?channel=coinsconference&amp;clip=flv_10da17fe-85ac-4b06-b9eb-ace1a97058d7">here</a>.</p>
<p>
The general gist of the talk informed the audience of the true nature of design, design thinking, and how it&#39;s going to make it&#39;s way into management.</p>
<p>
One thing Dick does well and does often, probably because of his philosophy background, is define terms. Having taken a few classes with him, I have found a new appreciation for definitions. So I just wanted to note a few he said during the talk and what they mean.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-1">
System
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-2">
<blockquote>
<p>All that has and will happen</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was to say that no one can understand a full system. No one can understand the full extent of an organization, an industry, even a pencil, because as he put it &#34;only God knows that&#34;. The implication of this statement is one that made me choose Service Design. Service Design and Interaction Design are experience driven, designing an organization is not. When you help shape a group of people, no one, not even yourself, will ever <strong>feel</strong> the product that you made. People don&#39;t feel systems, they feel their paths through those systems.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-2">
Product
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-2">
<blockquote>
<p>Anything made by man</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It&#39;s time to stop thinking design is about posters and toasters. Anything that is made by a human is a product of design. It&#39;s time to expand our understand of what it means to make something, and the mental processes which govern that process.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-3">
Interaction Design
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<blockquote>
<p>How people relate to others through the mediation of products.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Interaction design is NOT about computers. It&#39;s about people. Also, the reason I&#39;ve been slowly removing myself from Service Design, is that this definition places Service Design is a subset of Interaction Design, and honestly, I think that design is fragmented enough as it is. Someone once described the difference between Interaction Design and Interactive Design to me, and I wanted to shoot off my face at how inane the distinctions made were. Dick uses a division of design disciplines called the Four Orders of Design borrowed from Richard McKeon&#39;s previous division which I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll talk about later.</p>

<div id="outline-container-headline-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-4">
Entrepreneurship
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<blockquote>
<p>Inventing an idea and developing it in innovation that brings benefit to an organization and the people served by an organization</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This ladies and gentlemen is what Dick thinks Design will become in 10 years. Design will transition to Design Entrepreneurship as a way of bridging the gap between design an management. It will shuck off all the old baggage of the term &#34;design&#34; and take on a whole new skepticism of individuality and ego and competitiveness as we move into the next decade. It makes sense. Entrepreneurs come up with ideas, build business models around them, <strong>make shit happen</strong>. That&#39;s what I do now, only everything thinks I should be sticking to my wireframes.</p>

Skeptical Dialectic
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
I think this deserves a whole post on it&#39;s own.</p>
