      <description>Richard Buchanan was a professor at Carnegie Mellon&amp;#39;s Design School before leaving for the Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western. He&amp;#39;s a personal hero of mine, and one of the few people moving design into spaces that were previously owned by business and management. He recently gave a keynote talk at COINs and you should definitely check it out on livestream [here](http://www.livestream.com/newchannel/popoutplayer?channel=coinsconference&amp;amp;clip=flv_10da17fe-85ac-4b06-b9eb-ace1a97058d7).&#xA;The general gist of the talk informed the audience of the true nature of design, design thinking, and how it&amp;#39;s going to make it&amp;#39;s way into management.</description>
