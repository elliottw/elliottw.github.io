<p><em>Founder, Designer, 2022-Present</em><br>
Likenow is a mobile app aimed at bringing economic justice back to on-demand (Uber, Doordash, etc) gig workers, while also enabling many people who are not qualified for any other on-demand apps. The model is simple, allow anyone to join the platform offering whatever skills they possess, while building an application much like Uber that connects those workers with customers in real-time, all for free for the workers.</p>

Unfortunately, at the end of 2021, Capital One decided to terminate the wealth management department, laying off over 300 employees and the project came to an end.</p>
