<a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/likenow/">Likenow</a> is a mobile app aimed at bringing economic justice back to on-demand (Uber, Doordash, etc) gig workers, while also enabling many people who are not qualified for any other on-demand apps. The model is simple, allow anyone to join the platform offering whatever skills they possess, while building an application much like Uber that connects those workers with customers in real-time, all for free for the workers.</p>
<p>
Developed the app from conception to iOS App Store (currently pending approval). Performed extensive field research participating in the on-demand app ecosystem as a worker, moved from research to wireframes to pixel-perfect mockups as the only full-time designer.</p>

<strong>Sr Design Manager of Strategy<br>
2021</strong>
</span>

Joined Capital One’s Wealth Management Group pre-launch. Managed all design aspects of the Direct to Consumer service launch while introducing <a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/service-blueprinting-to-align-an-organization/">Service Blueprints for alignment</a> to the group as a way of unifying the efforts of designers, developers, wealth management associates and regulators. </p>
<p>
In addition to bringing together stakeholders across the group around a single document my team owned, I was responsible for managing a cross-functional team tasked with designing the cultural shift for the group as Wealth Managers moved from a 1:1 service model to a team based model. Unfortunately, at the end of 2021, Capital One decided to terminate the wealth management department, laying off over 300 employees and the project came to an end.</p>
