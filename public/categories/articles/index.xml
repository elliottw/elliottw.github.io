      <description>Problem: More Access = More Problems&#xA;As my coworking space gets larger, the space has been left open more often than I&amp;#39;d like. Some people suggested an alarm system or keyless entry system, some others suggested two membership tiers, a cheaper level without a key to the space, and a more expensive level with a key to the space–this would reduce the number of people with keys, hopefully increasing security.</description>

      <title>Starting a Coworking Space Doesn&#39;t Have to Be Hard</title>

      <description>Getting the people I got a grant from a local non-profit that allowed me to open a co-working space for one month. This grant included enough for rent, and that was about it. After one month, I had 12 people signed up and ready to go. After that landlord raised the rent by 50 percent, and after waiting to find a new space, I had 6 members left (it took 4 months to find a new home).</description>

      <title>Degrees of Freedom</title>

      <description>I have been working on some more interaction design problems, and it occurred to me that almost all computer applications seem like big multiple choice tests. How do you save a file? Well, you have a set of buttons, and menus, pick the correct answer by clicking, and then the next answer by clicking, and if you get a perfect score, you get to save the file. Sometimes there are more than one right answer to a question, sometimes questions are dependent, but in any case, it got me thinking about a not often talked about aspect of interfaces–degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>I Don&#39;t Care about Your New Framework</title>

      <description>At every design conference someone &amp;#34;invents&amp;#34; a new framework for looking at users. In more understandable terms, people continue to make up ways to divide someone&amp;#39;s life into little pieces. For some reason, they think their scissor cuts of work and play, digital and physical, or love and hate are better than others… I have no idea why.&#xA;Let&amp;#39;s Take a Look at a Few So you know what I&amp;#39;m talking about, here are some &amp;#34;ethnographic observation frameworks&amp;#34; I&amp;#39;ve collected over the years.</description>

      <title>Richard Buchanan COINs and Design Keynote Speach</title>

      <description>Richard Buchanan was a professor at Carnegie Mellon&amp;#39;s Design School before leaving for the Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western. He&amp;#39;s a personal hero of mine, and one of the few people moving design into spaces that were previously owned by business and management. He recently gave a keynote talk at COINs and you should definitely check it out on livestream here.&#xA;The general gist of the talk informed the audience of the true nature of design, design thinking, and how it&amp;#39;s going to make it&amp;#39;s way into management.</description>

      <title>The Shift from Modern to Post Modern in Design</title>

      <description>Design was about something. There were constraints of technology, constraints on production, limits on time and resources that could be devoted to projects which in turn would be products. Design disciplines, such as graphic and industrial, had heuristics–rules of thumb. Domain knowledge was acquired. Designers were masters of a trade. They were technical, efficient, and knowledgable. Disciplines also developed ethical standards which are still relevant today. For example, in graphic design, information should be presented in an honest manner, not used to deceive the reader.</description>

      <title>The Rhetorical Chain</title>

      <description>Rhetorical Chain: a string of arguments that pass through and connect people and organizations&#xA;Design as Rhetoric A lot of people see design as the bastard child of rhetoric. If you think about it, it makes sense. The five &amp;#34;canons&amp;#34; of rhetoric, brought forth by Cicero or somebody, consists of:&#xA;Invention and Discover Arrangement Style Memory Delivery These phases all have corollaries in design. I won&amp;#39;t go into that, but it should be pretty obvious to most designers.</description>

      <title>The Four Orders of Design</title>

      <description>With the surge of new concepts in design revolving around Design Management, Organizational Design, Systems Design, and the like, and the seemingly lost articulation of that domain set forth by Richard Buchanan, I thought this would be a good time to revisit the concept of Fourth Order Design, and lay out the orders and their origin in one coherent text.&#xA;Four Orders of Design Dick was the first to describe design disciplines in four domains of activity: symbolic and visual communication or graphic design, material or industrial design, activities and organized services or interaction and service design, and complex systems or organizational design.</description>
