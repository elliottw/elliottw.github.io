      <description>Alex Cheek and I developed this card deck over the course of a decade. The cards represent our unique approach to consulting work in business, healthcare, tech, and more. Their roots trace to Aristotle, John Dewey, Richard McKeon, Richard Buchanan, Shelley Evenson, Christopher Alexander, Kenneth Burke, and others — classical models that we have updated for contemporary problems.&#xA;These methods represent the belief that thinking differently through design is something that anybody can participate in; that it’s not a mode of thinking reserved for those with formal design training.</description>
